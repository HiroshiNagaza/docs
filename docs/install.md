# Getting Started

Running CitizenIV is very easy as downloading and running the files is largely intuitive.

## Downloading

1. Get the CitizenIV updater files from [here](https://citizeniv.net/files/CitizenIV.zip).
2. Create a new, separate folder for your CitizenIV installation. Ideally this folder is outside of your Grand Theft Auto IV folder but it must not be the Grand Theft Auto IV folder itself.
3. Extract the ZIP archive you downloaded earlier into your new CitizenIV folder.

## Launching

1. Start 'CitizenIV.exe' in your CitizenIV folder.
2. If this is your first time starting up CitizenIV it will ask you for the folder where you have Grand Theft Auto IV installed. You only have to do this once.
3. CitizenIV may prompt you to update the outdated cache, confirm this with a click on "Yes".
4. Once CitizenIV has started up, select a server in the server list by clicking on it and you should be able to join!
